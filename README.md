### Identifying Entities in Healthcare Data Assignment
Process and modify the data into sentence format. This step has to be done for the 'train_sent' and ‘train_label’ datasets and for test datasets as well.
After that, you need to define the features to build the CRF model.
Then, you need to apply these features in each sentence of the train and the test dataset to get the feature values.
Once the features are computed, you need to define the target variable and then build the CRF model.
Then, you need to perform the evaluation using a test data set.
After that, you need to create a dictionary in which diseases are keys and treatments are values.
